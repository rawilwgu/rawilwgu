- 👋 Hi, I’m Rachel Wilson.
- 👀 My hobbies include reading and writing. All throughout my career though, I've been handling data and would like to expand my hobbies into that. My degree through WGU has helped with that. I am passionate about learning different avenues to approach different situations.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking into individual projects outside of my finished degree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can get my hands on. I want to learn and practice as much as possible.
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach me through email.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have published poetry in the past and wrote several novels.
